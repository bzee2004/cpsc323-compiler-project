# About
### CPSC-323 Term Project - Rat25s Compiler

A compiler that is able to read files of the Rat25s language containing a variety of different tokens, and output files that categorize each of the tokens into identifiers, reals, integers, separaters, operators, and keywords. The tokens are then parsed and read in order to check if it follows our production rules.

# Technologies
C++

# Features
### On execution:
- reads an input file with different tokens
- outputs a file that categorizes these tokens
- reads tokens and determines if it is syntactically correct
- outputs a file highlighting the syntax analyzer process

# Usage
In CLI, run:
- ```./run.sh```
